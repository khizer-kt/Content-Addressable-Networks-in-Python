# Content-Addressable-Networks-in-Python
The provided code establishes a Content Addressable Network (CAN) and its associated functionalities through Python.   
It comprises two primary classes: *CANNode* and *ContentAddressableNetwork*.  
CANNode defines a node within the CAN network, featuring attributes such as ID, position (coordinates), and a list of neighboring nodes. On the other hand, ContentAddressableNetwork represents the entire network, encompassing a collection of nodes and methods for network manipulation and visualization.   
Key methods within ContentAddressableNetwork facilitate tasks such as calculating distances between positions, data hashing using SHA-1, node addition and removal, neighbor updates based on network alterations, network information display, and visualization via matplotlib. Additionally, data routing to the nearest node in the network is supported.   
In the main segment of the code, an instance of ContentAddressableNetwork is instantiated, followed by the addition of five random nodes. Subsequently, network information is displayed, and a scatter plot visualization is generated. Lastly, example data ("example_data") is routed to the nearest node in the network, with the outcome printed. In essence, this code orchestrates the setup and operation of a rudimentary Content Addressable Network, facilitating functionalities such as node management, visualization, and efficient data routing.
